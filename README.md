Project Title: Data Exploration with Azure SQL Database â€“ Customer, Account, and Loan Feeds

Objective:
Trainees will explore and manipulate multiple related datasets using Azure SQL Database. The focus will be on organizing the datasets, identifying data types, and exploring their relationships and contents.

Tools Required:
- Azure SQL Database
- SQL Management tools (Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio)
- Dataset - https://kaggle.com/datasets/9234c6c4d25b6eb7c3dbb15a0e33d65ae68a405d42acba8db1248defee7aff9c
- GitHub
Project Tasks:

1. Setting Up Azure SQL Database
   - Step 1.1: Create an Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal.
     - Define a new database and server.
   - Step 1.2: Name the database `CustomerAccountLoanDB`.

2. Data Organization
   - Step 2.1: Create tables for the provided feeds:
     - Customer Feed:
CREATE TABLE customers (
           customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
           first_name VARCHAR(50),
           last_name VARCHAR(50),
           address VARCHAR(100),
           city VARCHAR(50),
           state VARCHAR(50),
           zip VARCHAR(20)
       );



     - Account Feed:
       CREATE TABLE accounts (
           account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
           customer_id INT,
           account_type VARCHAR(50),
           balance DECIMAL(10, 2),
           FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
       );



     - Transaction Feed:
       CREATE TABLE transactions (
           transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
           account_id INT,
           transaction_date DATE,
           transaction_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
           transaction_type VARCHAR(50),
           FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(account_id)
       );



     - Loan Feed:
       CREATE TABLE loans (
           loan_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
           customer_id INT,
           loan_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
           interest_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
           loan_term INT,
           FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
       );


     - Loan Payment Feed:
       CREATE TABLE loan_payments (
           payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
           loan_id INT,
           payment_date DATE,
           payment_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
           FOREIGN KEY (loan_id) REFERENCES loans(loan_id)
       );



3. Data Insertion
   - Step 3.1: Populate tables with sample data using `INSERT INTO` statements for each table.
   - Step 3.2: Ensure data consistency and relationships, ensuring each foreign key points to valid primary keys.
Data available @ https://kaggle.com/datasets/9234c6c4d25b6eb7c3dbb15a0e33d65ae68a405d42acba8db1248defee7aff9c

4. Data Exploration
   - Step 4.1: Write query to retrieve all customer information:
   - Step 4.2: Query accounts for a specific customer:
   - Step 4.3: Find the customer name and account balance for each account
   - Step 4.4: Analyze customer loan balances:
   - Step 4.5: List all customers who have made a transaction in the 2024-03
5. Aggregation and Insights
   - Step 5.1: Calculate the total balance across all accounts for each customer:
   - Step 5.2: Calculate the average loan amount for each loan term:
   - Step 5.3: Find the total loan amount and interest across all loans:
   - Step 5.4: Find the most frequent transaction type
   - Step 5.5: Analyze transactions by account and transaction type:
6. Advanced Analysis
   - Step 6.1: Create a view of active loans with payments greater than $1000:
   - Step 6.2: Create an index on `transaction_date` in the `transactions` table for performance optimization:
Deliverables:
- A SQL script with the table creation and queries for data exploration.
- Screenshots of the queries and their results.
- Upload the SQL file (query.sql) and the document to GitHub.
